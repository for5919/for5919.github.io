Our recently established collaborative research initiative “Machine Learning for Complex Quantum States” (MLCQS) – a consortium spanning nine different institutions across Germany and Switzerland – is seeking to fill several PhD positions.

<!--more-->

MLCQS will develop and employ tools of machine learning to investigate composite quantum systems with a focus on artificial quantum systems. Advanced capabilities of modern experimental techniques to manipulate and probe many-body quantum systems have made quantum simulation and quantum computing with substantial numbers of qubits a reality. But at the same time, fully leveraging their potential poses new challenges related to high-dimensional state representations and data as well as optimal control strategies. MLCQS will tackle these challenges by developing machine-learning-enhanced techniques for simulation, data analysis, and control. Thereby, we will enable new insights into complex quantum states and dynamics.

We are looking for highly motivated candidates with a background in quantum many-body physics, quantum optics, or quantum information to work on the following projects
* Combining neural quantum states and quantum simulation: hybrid algorithms [theory]
PIs: Annabelle Bohrdt (LMU Munich)
* Information dynamics of strongly interacting Bosons [theory]
PI: Giuseppe Carleo (EPFL)
* Machine learning for qutrit-based quantum computing and simulation with Rydberg atoms [experiment/theory]
PIs: Monika Aidelsburger (MPQ, Garching), Annabelle Bohrdt (LMU Munich)
* Learning feedback control of monitored quantum dynamics [theory]
PIs: Marin Bukov (MPI PKS, Dresden), Markus Schmitt (Regensburg University)
* Optimal readout of quantum simulators [experiment]
PIs: Monika Aidelsburger (MPQ, Garching)

To make one of these your PhD project, send your CV and a motivation letter to applications@mlcqs.info. Applications will be reviewed starting DEADLINE.
