Martin Gärttner's research focuses on using synthetic quantum systems as physical simulation devices to explore quantum many-body phenomena. This requires the development of methods for benchmarking these devices using tools from quantum information theory and machine learning. Specifically, we develop methods for efficiently characterizing quantum states from measurements, for example quantifying their entanglement, and for simulating quantum many-body physics on classical computers, thereby pushing the limits of numerical methods. He is a professor at Jena University. For more information, see [https://qiqs-jena.de](https://qiqs-jena.de)
