Christof Weitenberg is an experimental physicist working with ultracold atoms. His research focus is on quantum many-body phases in optical lattices, in particular topological phases induced by Floquet engineering. Another focus are microscopy techniques including new matter-wave microscopy schemes. Christof Weitenberg obtained his PhD from LMU Munich, worked at ENS Paris and University of Hamburg and currently leads a research group at TU Dortmund University ([https://ucqg.physik.tu-dortmund.de/](https://ucqg.physik.tu-dortmund.de/)).
