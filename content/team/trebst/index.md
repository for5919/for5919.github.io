Simon Trebst applies computational many-body approaches to study entangled states of matter, often from a conceptual perspective. His interests oscillate between exploring long-range entangled quantum ground states, such as spin liquids, in the context of frustrated magnets and Kitaev materials and understanding highly entangled mixed states arising quantum circuit dynamics. Recent themes include monitored quantum criticality, decoding transitions, and quantum chaos.
