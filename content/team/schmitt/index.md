Markus Schmitt is a theoretical physicist with a focus on computational quantum many-body physics. He investigates correlated quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, targeting research questions that range from the characterization of non-equilibrium quantum matter to the optimal implementation of quantum logical operations. For this purpose, he develops novel computational approaches, that incorporate machine learning tools to address central challenges. Markus pursues his research as a group leader at the Regensburg University and Forschungszentrum Jülich. For more details, see the [group website](https://www.computational-quantum.science).
