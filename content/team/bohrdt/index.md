Annabelle Bohrdt is a theoretical physicist aiming for a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated quantum systems by developing new analysis tools. In her research, she combines numerical methods, intuitive physical pictures, close collaboration with quantum simulation experiments, and machine learning techniques. She obtained her doctoral degree from Technical University Munich (Germany). During her PhD, Annabelle spent two years as an exchange student in the group of Eugene Demler at Harvard. From 2021 to 2023, she was an independent ITAMP postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. From 2023 to 2025, she was a professor for theoretical physics at the University of Regensburg, Germany. In 2025, she joined the faculty of LMU Munich, Germany.
